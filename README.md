relplot 1.4
-----------

This is a program for generating attractive plots of the solutions
to equations. It uses interval arithmetic to efficiently approximate
these solutions. Output is generated as PostScript. The program is written
largely in SML, plus some PostScript. Use "make" to build it with the SML
executable.

The shell script "relplot" is used to generate PostScript output. "relplot-pdf"
generates PDF output. "plot.pl" is designed to be invoked from a web interface,
as at the installation at:
